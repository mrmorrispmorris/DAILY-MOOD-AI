## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Why This Happened:**
1. **Development Oversight**: Buttons were styled but functionality not implemented
2. **Demo/Placeholder Code**: Some buttons were placeholders for future features
3. **Component Reuse**: Some components copied without proper event handlers
4. **Testing Gap**: UI testing didn't catch missing click handlers

### **Prevention Measures:**
1. **Button Audit Script**: Created systematic button checking
2. **Required onClick**: All buttons must have click handlers
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Coming soon messages for unfinished features
4. **User Feedback**: All interactions provide immediate feedback
