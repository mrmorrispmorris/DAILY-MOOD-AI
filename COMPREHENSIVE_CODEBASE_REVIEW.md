### 4. **REVENUE SYSTEM** ⚠️ **NEEDS OPTIMIZATION**
**Files**: `app/pricing/page.tsx`, `app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`

```
❌ CURRENT: $9.99/month (too expensive vs competition)
❌ DAYLIO: $2.99/month or $4.99 one-time
❌ CONVERSION BLOCKER: Price resistance
```

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Price Point**: 233% higher than main competitor
2. **No Yearly Discount**: Should offer significant annual savings
3. **Single Tier**: Missing Basic/Pro/Enterprise options
4. **Free Trial**: 14 days might be too short for habit formation

**Revenue Optimization Strategy**:
```
🎯 NEW PRICING STRATEGY:
- Basic: $4.99/month (compete with Daylio)
