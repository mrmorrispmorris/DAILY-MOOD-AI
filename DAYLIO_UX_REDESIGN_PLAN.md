## Mission: Transform Overwhelming Interface ‚Üí Simple, Fun, Intuitive

---

## üö® CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:

### **Current Issues:**
‚ùå **Layout Chaos:** Year in Pixels calendar dominates entire page  
‚ùå **Color Overload:** Gradients everywhere causing readability issues  
‚ùå **Poor Hierarchy:** Mood entry buried below massive calendar  
‚ùå **Overwhelming:** Too many sections stacked vertically  
‚ùå **AutoCAD Feel:** Complex, technical instead of fun and simple  

### **User Feedback:**
> "It looks terrible... I cant see a lot of the text... The calender takes up most of the page... It is overwhelming... looks more like autocad than a fun to use mood tracking app"
