## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. NO PHASE SKIPPING
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Security and testing cannot be retrofitted easily
- User experience improvements need stable foundation

### 2. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
- Features developed in later phases must not break earlier work
- All changes must be tested against existing functionality
- Monitoring must catch regressions immediately

### 3. USER-CENTRIC APPROACH
- Every technical decision must consider user impact
- Performance optimizations directly affect conversion rates
- Security issues can destroy user trust permanently

### 4. BUSINESS METRICS ALIGNMENT  
- Every phase must contribute to $10K/month goal
- Technical work without business impact is waste
- User experience improvements must improve conversion rates
