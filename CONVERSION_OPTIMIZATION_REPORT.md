- **Show capability**, don't solve problems  
- **Build scarcity**, don't provide abundance
- **Position premium**, don't commoditize value

### **Revenue Strategy:**
- **Demo = Sales tool**, not free service
- **Premium = Exclusive access**, not optional upgrade
- **AI insights = Competitive advantage**, not commodity feature

---

## 📊 **BOTTOM LINE**

Users got valuable advice for free → No incentive to upgrade

### **AFTER**: Demo That Drives Revenue 📈  
Users see premium value preview → Strong incentive to unlock full analysis

### **BUSINESS IMPACT**: 🎯
**Transformed demo from cost center to profit driver**

This single optimization could be worth **thousands in additional monthly revenue** by properly positioning premium features and creating conversion desire instead of satisfaction.

**The demo now works FOR the business instead of AGAINST it.** 🚀
